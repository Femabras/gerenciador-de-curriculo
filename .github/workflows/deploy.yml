    steps:
      # 1. Checkout the repository code
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Setup Node.js environment

      # 3. CRITICAL FIX: Explicitly change directory for the build process
      - name: Change to Frontend Directory
        run: cd frontend

      # 4. Install dependencies - now runs correctly from within the 'frontend' folder
      # Note: We use 'npm ci' and rely on the preceding 'cd frontend' step.
      - name: Install dependencies
        # This will now execute as: cd frontend && npm ci
        run: npm ci

      # 5. Build the React application
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      # 6. Upload the 'dist' folder content as a deployment artifact
      - name: Upload GitHub Pages artifact

        with:
          # The path is now relative to the root, pointing into the frontend sub-folder.
          # The 'dist' folder itself is created inside 'frontend' by the build step.

      # 7. Deploy the uploaded artifact to GitHub Pages
